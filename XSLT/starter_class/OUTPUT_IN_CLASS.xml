    <line n="1">From fairest creatures we desire increase,</line>
    <line n="2">That thereby beauty's rose might never die,</line>
    <line n="3">But as the riper should by time decease,</line>
    <line n="4">His tender heir might bear his memory:</line>
    <line n="5">But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,</line>
    <line n="6">Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,</line>
    <line n="7">Making a famine where abundance lies,</line>
    <line n="8">Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:</line>
    <line n="9">Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,</line>
    <line n="10">And only herald to the gaudy spring,</line>
    <line n="11">Within thine own bud buriest thy content,</line>
    <line n="12">And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:</line>
    <line n="13">Pity the world, or else this glutton be,</line>
    <line n="14">To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="15">When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,</line>
    <line n="16">And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,</line>
    <line n="17">Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,</line>
    <line n="18">Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:</line>
    <line n="19">Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,</line>
    <line n="20">Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;</line>
    <line n="21">To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,</line>
    <line n="22">Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.</line>
    <line n="23">How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,</line>
    <line n="24">If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine</line>
    <line n="25">Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'</line>
    <line n="26">Proving his beauty by succession thine!</line>
    <line n="27">This were to be new made when thou art old,</line>
    <line n="28">And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="29">Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest</line>
    <line n="30">Now is the time that face should form another;</line>
    <line n="31">Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,</line>
    <line n="32">Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.</line>
    <line n="33">For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb</line>
    <line n="34">Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?</line>
    <line n="35">Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,</line>
    <line n="36">Of his self-love to stop posterity?</line>
    <line n="37">Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee</line>
    <line n="38">Calls back the lovely April of her prime;</line>
    <line n="39">So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,</line>
    <line n="40">Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.</line>
    <line n="41">But if thou live, remember'd not to be,</line>
    <line n="42">Die single and thine image dies with thee.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="43">Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend</line>
    <line n="44">Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?</line>
    <line n="45">Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,</line>
    <line n="46">And being frank she lends to those are free:</line>
    <line n="47">Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse</line>
    <line n="48">The bounteous largess given thee to give?</line>
    <line n="49">Profitless usurer, why dost thou use</line>
    <line n="50">So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?</line>
    <line n="51">For having traffic with thy self alone,</line>
    <line n="52">Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:</line>
    <line n="53">Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,</line>
    <line n="54">What acceptable audit canst thou leave?</line>
    <line n="55">Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,</line>
    <line n="56">Which, used, lives th' executor to be.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="57">Those hours, that with gentle work did frame</line>
    <line n="58">The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,</line>
    <line n="59">Will play the tyrants to the very same</line>
    <line n="60">And that unfair which fairly doth excel;</line>
    <line n="61">For never-resting time leads summer on</line>
    <line n="62">To hideous winter, and confounds him there;</line>
    <line n="63">Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,</line>
    <line n="64">Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:</line>
    <line n="65">Then were not summer's distillation left,</line>
    <line n="66">A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,</line>
    <line n="67">Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,</line>
    <line n="68">Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:</line>
    <line n="69">But flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,</line>
    <line n="70">Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="71">Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,</line>
    <line n="72">In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:</line>
    <line n="73">Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place</line>
    <line n="74">With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.</line>
    <line n="75">That use is not forbidden usury,</line>
    <line n="76">Which happies those that pay the willing loan;</line>
    <line n="77">That's for thy self to breed another thee,</line>
    <line n="78">Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;</line>
    <line n="79">Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,</line>
    <line n="80">If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:</line>
    <line n="81">Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,</line>
    <line n="82">Leaving thee living in posterity?</line>
    <line n="83">Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair</line>
    <line n="84">To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="85">Lo! in the orient when the gracious light</line>
    <line n="86">Lifts up his burning head, each under eye</line>
    <line n="87">Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,</line>
    <line n="88">Serving with looks his sacred majesty;</line>
    <line n="89">And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,</line>
    <line n="90">Resembling strong youth in his middle age,</line>
    <line n="91">Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,</line>
    <line n="92">Attending on his golden pilgrimage:</line>
    <line n="93">But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,</line>
    <line n="94">Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,</line>
    <line n="95">The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are</line>
    <line n="96">From his low tract, and look another way:</line>
    <line n="97">So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:</line>
    <line n="98">Unlook'd, on diest unless thou get a son.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="99">Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?</line>
    <line n="100">Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:</line>
    <line n="101">Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,</line>
    <line n="102">Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?</line>
    <line n="103">If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,</line>
    <line n="104">By unions married, do offend thine ear,</line>
    <line n="105">They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds</line>
    <line n="106">In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.</line>
    <line n="107">Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,</line>
    <line n="108">Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;</line>
    <line n="109">Resembling sire and child and happy mother,</line>
    <line n="110">Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:</line>
    <line n="111">Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,</line>
    <line n="112">Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.'</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="113">Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,</line>
    <line n="114">That thou consum'st thy self in single life?</line>
    <line n="115">Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,</line>
    <line n="116">The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;</line>
    <line n="117">The world will be thy widow and still weep</line>
    <line n="118">That thou no form of thee hast left behind,</line>
    <line n="119">When every private widow well may keep</line>
    <line n="120">By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:</line>
    <line n="121">Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend</line>
    <line n="122">Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;</line>
    <line n="123">But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,</line>
    <line n="124">And kept unused the user so destroys it.</line>
    <line n="125">No love toward others in that bosom sits</line>
    <line n="126">That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="127">For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,</line>
    <line n="128">Who for thy self art so unprovident.</line>
    <line n="129">Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov'd of many,</line>
    <line n="130">But that thou none lov'st is most evident:</line>
    <line n="131">For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate,</line>
    <line n="132">That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,</line>
    <line n="133">Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate</line>
    <line n="134">Which to repair should be thy chief desire.</line>
    <line n="135">O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:</line>
    <line n="136">Shall hate be fairer lodg'd than gentle love?</line>
    <line n="137">Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,</line>
    <line n="138">Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:</line>
    <line n="139">Make thee another self for love of me,</line>
    <line n="140">That beauty still may live in thine or thee.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="141">As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,</line>
    <line n="142">In one of thine, from that which thou departest;</line>
    <line n="143">And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st,</line>
    <line n="144">Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,</line>
    <line n="145">Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;</line>
    <line n="146">Without this folly, age, and cold decay:</line>
    <line n="147">If all were minded so, the times should cease</line>
    <line n="148">And threescore year would make the world away.</line>
    <line n="149">Let those whom nature hath not made for store,</line>
    <line n="150">Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:</line>
    <line n="151">Look, whom she best endow'd, she gave thee more;</line>
    <line n="152">Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:</line>
    <line n="153">She carv'd thee for her seal, and meant thereby,</line>
    <line n="154">Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="155">When I do count the clock that tells the time,</line>
    <line n="156">And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;</line>
    <line n="157">When I behold the violet past prime,</line>
    <line n="158">And sable curls, all silvered o'er with white;</line>
    <line n="159">When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,</line>
    <line n="160">Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,</line>
    <line n="161">And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,</line>
    <line n="162">Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,</line>
    <line n="163">Then of thy beauty do I question make,</line>
    <line n="164">That thou among the wastes of time must go,</line>
    <line n="165">Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake</line>
    <line n="166">And die as fast as they see others grow;</line>
    <line n="167">And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence</line>
    <line n="168">Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="169">O! that you were your self; but, love you are</line>
    <line n="170">No longer yours, than you your self here live:</line>
    <line n="171">Against this coming end you should prepare,</line>
    <line n="172">And your sweet semblance to some other give:</line>
    <line n="173">So should that beauty which you hold in lease</line>
    <line n="174">Find no determination; then you were</line>
    <line n="175">Yourself again, after yourself's decease,</line>
    <line n="176">When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.</line>
    <line n="177">Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,</line>
    <line n="178">Which husbandry in honour might uphold,</line>
    <line n="179">Against the stormy gusts of winter's day</line>
    <line n="180">And barren rage of death's eternal cold?</line>
    <line n="181">O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,</line>
    <line n="182">You had a father: let your son say so.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="183">Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;</line>
    <line n="184">And yet methinks I have astronomy,</line>
    <line n="185">But not to tell of good or evil luck,</line>
    <line n="186">Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;</line>
    <line n="187">Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,</line>
    <line n="188">Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,</line>
    <line n="189">Or say with princes if it shall go well</line>
    <line n="190">By oft predict that I in heaven find:</line>
    <line n="191">But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,</line>
    <line n="192">And constant stars in them I read such art</line>
    <line n="193">As 'Truth and beauty shall together thrive,</line>
    <line n="194">If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert';</line>
    <line n="195">Or else of thee this I prognosticate:</line> 'Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and
    date.' </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="196">When I consider every thing that grows</line>
    <line n="197">Holds in perfection but a little moment,</line>
    <line n="198">That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows</line>
    <line n="199">Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;</line>
    <line n="200">When I perceive that men as plants increase,</line>
    <line n="201">Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,</line>
    <line n="202">Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,</line>
    <line n="203">And wear their brave state out of memory;</line>
    <line n="204">Then the conceit of this inconstant stay</line>
    <line n="205">Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,</line>
    <line n="206">Where wasteful Time debateth with decay</line>
    <line n="207">To change your day of youth to sullied night,</line>
    <line n="208">And all in war with Time for love of you,</line>
    <line n="209">As he takes from you, I engraft you new.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="210">But wherefore do not you a mightier way</line>
    <line n="211">Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?</line>
    <line n="212">And fortify your self in your decay</line>
    <line n="213">With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?</line>
    <line n="214">Now stand you on the top of happy hours,</line>
    <line n="215">And many maiden gardens, yet unset,</line>
    <line n="216">With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,</line>
    <line n="217">Much liker than your painted counterfeit:</line>
    <line n="218">So should the lines of life that life repair,</line>
    <line n="219">Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,</line>
    <line n="220">Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,</line>
    <line n="221">Can make you live your self in eyes of men.</line>
    <line n="222">To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,</line>
    <line n="223">And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="224">Who will believe my verse in time to come,</line>
    <line n="225">If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?</line>
    <line n="226">Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb</line>
    <line n="227">Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.</line>
    <line n="228">If I could write the beauty of your eyes,</line>
    <line n="229">And in fresh numbers number all your graces,</line>
    <line n="230">The age to come would say 'This poet lies;</line>
    <line n="231">Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'</line>
    <line n="232">So should my papers, yellow'd with their age,</line>
    <line n="233">Be scorn'd, like old men of less truth than tongue,</line>
    <line n="234">And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage</line>
    <line n="235">And stretched metre of an antique song:</line>
    <line n="236">But were some child of yours alive that time,</line>
    <line n="237">You should live twice,--in it, and in my rhyme.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="238">Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</line>
    <line n="239">Thou art more lovely and more temperate:</line>
    <line n="240">Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</line>
    <line n="241">And summer's lease hath all too short a date:</line>
    <line n="242">Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</line>
    <line n="243">And often is his gold complexion dimm'd,</line>
    <line n="244">And every fair from fair sometime declines,</line>
    <line n="245">By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:</line>
    <line n="246">But thy eternal summer shall not fade,</line>
    <line n="247">Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,</line>
    <line n="248">Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,</line>
    <line n="249">When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,</line>
    <line n="250">So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,</line>
    <line n="251">So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="252">Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,</line>
    <line n="253">And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;</line>
    <line n="254">Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,</line>
    <line n="255">And burn the long-liv'd phoenix, in her blood;</line>
    <line n="256">Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,</line>
    <line n="257">And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,</line>
    <line n="258">To the wide world and all her fading sweets;</line>
    <line n="259">But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:</line>
    <line n="260">O! carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,</line>
    <line n="261">Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;</line>
    <line n="262">Him in thy course untainted do allow</line>
    <line n="263">For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.</line>
    <line n="264">Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,</line>
    <line n="265">My love shall in my verse ever live young.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="266">A woman's face with nature's own hand painted,</line>
    <line n="267">Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;</line>
    <line n="268">A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted</line>
    <line n="269">With shifting change, as is false women's fashion:</line>
    <line n="270">An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,</line>
    <line n="271">Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;</line>
    <line n="272">A man in hue all 'hues' in his controlling,</line>
    <line n="273">Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.</line>
    <line n="274">And for a woman wert thou first created;</line>
    <line n="275">Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,</line>
    <line n="276">And by addition me of thee defeated,</line>
    <line n="277">By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.</line>
    <line n="278">But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,</line>
    <line n="279">Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="280">So is it not with me as with that Muse,</line>
    <line n="281">Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,</line>
    <line n="282">Who heaven itself for ornament doth use</line>
    <line n="283">And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,</line>
    <line n="284">Making a couplement of proud compare'</line>
    <line n="285">With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,</line>
    <line n="286">With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare,</line>
    <line n="287">That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.</line>
    <line n="288">O! let me, true in love, but truly write,</line>
    <line n="289">And then believe me, my love is as fair</line>
    <line n="290">As any mother's child, though not so bright</line>
    <line n="291">As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:</line>
    <line n="292">Let them say more that like of hearsay well;</line>
    <line n="293">I will not praise that purpose not to sell.</line>

    <line n="294">My glass shall not persuade me I am old,</line>

    <line n="297">Then look I death my days should expiate.</line>
    <line n="298">For all that beauty that doth cover thee,</line>
    <line n="299">Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,</line>
    <line n="300">Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:</line>
    <line n="301">How can I then be elder than thou art?</line>
    <line n="302">O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary</line>
    <line n="303">As I, not for myself, but for thee will;</line>
    <line n="304">Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary</line>

    <line n="311">Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;</line>
    <line n="312">So I, for fear of trust, forget to say</line>
    <line n="313">The perfect ceremony of love's rite,</line>
    <line n="314">And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,</line>
    <line n="315">O'ercharg'd with burthen of mine own love's might.</line>
    <line n="316">O! let my looks be then the eloquence</line>
    <line n="317">And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,</line>
    <line n="318">Who plead for love, and look for recompense,</line>
    <line n="319">More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.</line>
    <line n="320">O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:</line>
    <line n="321">To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="322">Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd,</line>
    <line n="323">Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;</line>
    <line n="324">My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,</line>
    <line n="325">And perspective it is best painter's art.</line>
    <line n="326">For through the painter must you see his skill,</line>
    <line n="327">To find where your true image pictur'd lies,</line>
    <line n="328">Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,</line>
    <line n="329">That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.</line>
    <line n="330">Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:</line>
    <line n="331">Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me</line>
    <line n="332">Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun</line>
    <line n="333">Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;</line>
    <line n="334">Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,</line>
    <line n="335">They draw but what they see, know not the heart.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="336">Let those who are in favour with their stars</line>
    <line n="337">Of public honour and proud titles boast,</line>
    <line n="338">Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars</line>
    <line n="339">Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.</line>
    <line n="340">Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread</line>
    <line n="341">But as the marigold at the sun's eye,</line>
    <line n="342">And in themselves their pride lies buried,</line>
    <line n="343">For at a frown they in their glory die.</line>
    <line n="344">The painful warrior famoused for fight,</line>
    <line n="345">After a thousand victories once foil'd,</line>
    <line n="346">Is from the book of honour razed quite,</line>
    <line n="347">And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:</line>
    <line n="348">Then happy I, that love and am belov'd,</line>
    <line n="349">Where I may not remove nor be remov'd.</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="350">Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage</line>
    <line n="351">Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,</line>
    <line n="352">To thee I send this written embassage,</line>
    <line n="353">To witness duty, not to show my wit:</line>
    <line n="354">Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine</line>
    <line n="355">May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,</line>
    <line n="356">But that I hope some good conceit of thine</line>
    <line n="357">In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it:</line>
    <line n="358">Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,</line>
    <line n="359">Points on me graciously with fair aspect,</line>
    <line n="360">And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,</line>
    <line n="361">To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:</line>
    <line n="362">Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;</line>
    <line n="363">Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="364">Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,</line>
    <line n="365">The dear respose for limbs with travel tir'd;</line>
    <line n="366">But then begins a journey in my head</line>
    <line n="367">To work my mind, when body's work's expired:</line>
    <line n="368">For then my thoughts--from far where I abide--</line>
    <line n="369">Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,</line>
    <line n="370">And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,</line>
    <line n="371">Looking on darkness which the blind do see:</line>
    <line n="372">Save that my soul's imaginary sight</line>
    <line n="373">Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,</line>
    <line n="374">Which, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,</line>
    <line n="375">Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.</line>
    <line n="376">Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,</line>
    <line n="377">For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="378">How can I then return in happy plight,</line>
    <line n="379">That am debarre'd the benefit of rest?</line>
    <line n="380">When day's oppression is not eas'd by night,</line>
    <line n="381">But day by night and night by day oppress'd,</line>
    <line n="382">And each, though enemies to either's reign,</line>
    <line n="383">Do in consent shake hands to torture me,</line>
    <line n="384">The one by toil, the other to complain</line>
    <line n="385">How far I toil, still farther off from thee.</line>
    <line n="386">I tell the day, to please him thou art bright,</line>
    <line n="387">And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:</line>
    <line n="388">So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,</line>
    <line n="389">When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.</line>
    <line n="390">But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer,</line>
    <line n="391">And night doth nightly make grief's length seem stronger.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="392">When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes</line>
    <line n="393">I all alone beweep my outcast state,</line>
    <line n="394">And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,</line>
    <line n="395">And look upon myself, and curse my fate,</line>
    <line n="396">Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</line>
    <line n="397">Featur'd like him, like him with friends possess'd,</line>
    <line n="398">Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope,</line>
    <line n="399">With what I most enjoy contented least;</line>
    <line n="400">Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,</line>
    <line n="401">Haply I think on thee,-- and then my state,</line>
    <line n="402">Like to the lark at break of day arising</line>
    <line n="403">From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;</line>
    <line n="404">For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings</line>
    <line n="405">That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="406">When to the sessions of sweet silent thought</line>
    <line n="407">I summon up remembrance of things past,</line>
    <line n="408">I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,</line>
    <line n="409">And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:</line>
    <line n="410">Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,</line>
    <line n="411">For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,</line>
    <line n="412">And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,</line>
    <line n="413">And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:</line>
    <line n="414">Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,</line>
    <line n="415">And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er</line>
    <line n="416">The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,</line>
    <line n="417">Which I new pay as if not paid before.</line>
    <line n="418">But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,</line>
    <line n="419">All losses are restor'd and sorrows end.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="420">Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,</line>
    <line n="421">Which I by lacking have supposed dead;</line>
    <line n="422">And there reigns Love, and all Love's loving parts,</line>
    <line n="423">And all those friends which I thought buried.</line>
    <line n="424">How many a holy and obsequious tear</line>
    <line n="425">Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye,</line>
    <line n="426">As interest of the dead, which now appear</line>
    <line n="427">But things remov'd that hidden in thee lie!</line>
    <line n="428">Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,</line>
    <line n="429">Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,</line>
    <line n="430">Who all their parts of me to thee did give,</line>
    <line n="431">That due of many now is thine alone:</line>
    <line n="432">Their images I lov'd, I view in thee,</line>
    <line n="433">And thou--all they--hast all the all of me.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="434">If thou survive my well-contented day,</line>
    <line n="435">When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover</line>
    <line n="436">And shalt by fortune once more re-survey</line>
    <line n="437">These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,</line>
    <line n="438">Compare them with the bett'ring of the time,</line>
    <line n="439">And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,</line>
    <line n="440">Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,</line>
    <line n="441">Exceeded by the height of happier men.</line>
    <line n="442">O! then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:</line> 'Had my friend's Muse grown with this
    growing age, <line n="443">A dearer birth than this his love had brought,</line>
    <line n="444">To march in ranks of better equipage:</line>
    <line n="445">But since he died and poets better prove,</line>
    <line n="446">Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love'.</line>
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="447">Full many a glorious morning have I seen</line>
    <line n="448">Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye,</line>
    <line n="449">Kissing with golden face the meadows green,</line>
    <line n="450">Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;</line>
    <line n="451">Anon permit the basest clouds to ride</line>
    <line n="452">With ugly rack on his celestial face,</line>
    <line n="453">And from the forlorn world his visage hide,</line>
    <line n="454">Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:</line>
    <line n="455">Even so my sun one early morn did shine,</line>
    <line n="456">With all triumphant splendour on my brow;</line>
    <line n="457">But out! alack! he was but one hour mine,</line>
    <line n="458">The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.</line>
    <line n="459">Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;</line>
    <line n="460">Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="461">Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,</line>
    <line n="462">And make me travel forth without my cloak,</line>
    <line n="463">To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,</line>
    <line n="464">Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?</line> 'Tis not enough that through the cloud
    thou break, <line n="465">To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,</line>
    <line n="466">For no man well of such a salve can speak,</line>
    <line n="467">That heals the wound, and cures not the disgrace:</line>
    <line n="468">Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;</line>
    <line n="469">Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:</line>
    <line n="470">The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief</line>
    <line n="471">To him that bears the strong offence's cross.</line>
    <line n="472">Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,</line>
    <line n="473">And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.</line>
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="474">No more be griev'd at that which thou hast done:</line>
    <line n="475">Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud:</line>
    <line n="476">Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,</line>
    <line n="477">And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.</line>
    <line n="478">All men make faults, and even I in this,</line>
    <line n="479">Authorizing thy trespass with compare,</line>
    <line n="480">Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,</line>
    <line n="481">Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;</line>
    <line n="482">For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,--</line>
    <line n="483">Thy adverse party is thy advocate,--</line>
    <line n="484">And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:</line>
    <line n="485">Such civil war is in my love and hate,</line>
    <line n="486">That I an accessary needs must be,</line>
    <line n="487">To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="488">Let me confess that we two must be twain,</line>
    <line n="489">Although our undivided loves are one:</line>
    <line n="490">So shall those blots that do with me remain,</line>
    <line n="491">Without thy help, by me be borne alone.</line>
    <line n="492">In our two loves there is but one respect,</line>
    <line n="493">Though in our lives a separable spite,</line>
    <line n="494">Which though it alter not love's sole effect,</line>
    <line n="495">Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.</line>
    <line n="496">I may not evermore acknowledge thee,</line>
    <line n="497">Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,</line>
    <line n="498">Nor thou with public kindness honour me,</line>
    <line n="499">Unless thou take that honour from thy name:</line>
    <line n="500">But do not so, I love thee in such sort,</line>
    <line n="501">As thou being mine, mine is thy good report.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="502">As a decrepit father takes delight</line>
    <line n="503">To see his active child do deeds of youth,</line>
    <line n="504">So I, made lame by Fortune's dearest spite,</line>
    <line n="505">Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth;</line>
    <line n="506">For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,</line>
    <line n="507">Or any of these all, or all, or more,</line>
    <line n="508">Entitled in thy parts, do crowned sit,</line>
    <line n="509">I make my love engrafted, to this store:</line>
    <line n="510">So then I am not lame, poor, nor despis'd,</line>
    <line n="511">Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give</line>
    <line n="512">That I in thy abundance am suffic'd,</line>
    <line n="513">And by a part of all thy glory live.</line>
    <line n="514">Look what is best, that best I wish in thee:</line>
    <line n="515">This wish I have; then ten times happy me!</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="516">How can my muse want subject to invent,</line>
    <line n="517">While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse</line>
    <line n="518">Thine own sweet argument, too excellent</line>
    <line n="519">For every vulgar paper to rehearse?</line>
    <line n="520">O! give thy self the thanks, if aught in me</line>
    <line n="521">Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;</line>
    <line n="522">For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,</line>
    <line n="523">When thou thy self dost give invention light?</line>
    <line n="524">Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth</line>
    <line n="525">Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;</line>
    <line n="526">And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth</line>
    <line n="527">Eternal numbers to outlive long date.</line>
    <line n="528">If my slight muse do please these curious days,</line>
    <line n="529">The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.</line>

    <line n="530">O! how thy worth with manners may I sing,</line>
    <line n="531">When thou art all the better part of me?</line>

    <line n="533">And what is't but mine own when I praise thee?</line>
    <line n="534">Even for this, let us divided live,</line>
    <line n="535">And our dear love lose name of single one,</line>
    <line n="536">That by this separation I may give</line>
    <line n="537">That due to thee which thou deserv'st alone.</line>
    <line n="538">O absence! what a torment wouldst thou prove,</line>
    <line n="539">Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave,</line>
    <line n="540">To entertain the time with thoughts of love,</line>
    <line n="541">Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,</line>
    <line n="542">And that thou teachest how to make one twain,</line>
    <line n="543">By praising him here who doth hence remain.</line>

    <line n="547">All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more.</line>
    <line n="548">Then, if for my love, thou my love receivest,</line>

    <line n="558">Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits,</line>
    <line n="559">When I am sometime absent from thy heart,</line>
    <line n="560">Thy beauty, and thy years full well befits,</line>

    <line n="600">If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,</line>

    <line n="618">For when these quicker elements are gone</line>
    <line n="619">In tender embassy of love to thee,</line>
    <line n="620">My life, being made of four, with two alone</line>
    <line n="621">Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;</line>
    <line n="622">Until life's composition be recur'd</line>
    <line n="623">By those swift messengers return'd from thee,</line>
    <line n="624">Who even but now come back again, assur'd,</line>
    <line n="625">Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:</line>
    <line n="626">This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,</line>
    <line n="627">I send them back again, and straight grow sad.</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="628">Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war,</line>
    <line n="629">How to divide the conquest of thy sight;</line>
    <line n="630">Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,</line>
    <line n="631">My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.</line>
    <line n="632">My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie,--</line>
    <line n="633">A closet never pierc'd with crystal eyes--</line>
    <line n="634">But the defendant doth that plea deny,</line>
    <line n="635">And says in him thy fair appearance lies.</line>
    <line n="636">To side this title is impannelled</line>
    <line n="637">A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart;</line>
    <line n="638">And by their verdict is determined</line>
    <line n="639">The clear eye's moiety, and the dear heart's part:</line>
    <line n="640">As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,</line>
    <line n="641">And my heart's right, thy inward love of heart.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="642">Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,</line>
    <line n="643">And each doth good turns now unto the other:</line>
    <line n="644">When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,</line>
    <line n="645">Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,</line>
    <line n="646">With my love's picture then my eye doth feast,</line>
    <line n="647">And to the painted banquet bids my heart;</line>
    <line n="648">Another time mine eye is my heart's guest,</line>
    <line n="649">And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:</line>
    <line n="650">So, either by thy picture or my love,</line>
    <line n="651">Thy self away, art present still with me;</line>
    <line n="652">For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,</line>
    <line n="653">And I am still with them, and they with thee;</line>
    <line n="654">Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight</line>
    <line n="655">Awakes my heart, to heart's and eye's delight.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="656">How careful was I when I took my way,</line>
    <line n="657">Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,</line>
    <line n="658">That to my use it might unused stay</line>
    <line n="659">From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!</line>
    <line n="660">But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,</line>
    <line n="661">Most worthy comfort, now my greatest grief,</line>
    <line n="662">Thou best of dearest, and mine only care,</line>
    <line n="663">Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.</line>
    <line n="664">Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,</line>
    <line n="665">Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,</line>
    <line n="666">Within the gentle closure of my breast,</line>
    <line n="667">From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;</line>
    <line n="668">And even thence thou wilt be stol'n I fear,</line>
    <line n="669">For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="670">Against that time, if ever that time come,</line>
    <line n="671">When I shall see thee frown on my defects,</line>
    <line n="672">When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,</line>
    <line n="673">Call'd to that audit by advis'd respects;</line>
    <line n="674">Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass,</line>
    <line n="675">And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,</line>
    <line n="676">When love, converted from the thing it was,</line>
    <line n="677">Shall reasons find of settled gravity;</line>
    <line n="678">Against that time do I ensconce me here,</line>
    <line n="679">Within the knowledge of mine own desert,</line>
    <line n="680">And this my hand, against my self uprear,</line>
    <line n="681">To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:</line>
    <line n="682">To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,</line>
    <line n="683">Since why to love I can allege no cause.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="684">How heavy do I journey on the way,</line>
    <line n="685">When what I seek, my weary travel's end,</line>
    <line n="686">Doth teach that ease and that repose to say,</line> 'Thus far the miles are measured from
    thy friend!' <line n="687">The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,</line>
    <line n="688">Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,</line>
    <line n="689">As if by some instinct the wretch did know</line>
    <line n="690">His rider lov'd not speed, being made from thee:</line>
    <line n="691">The bloody spur cannot provoke him on,</line>
    <line n="692">That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,</line>
    <line n="693">Which heavily he answers with a groan,</line>
    <line n="694">More sharp to me than spurring to his side;</line>
    <line n="695">For that same groan doth put this in my mind,</line>
    <line n="696">My grief lies onward, and my joy behind.</line>
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="697">Thus can my love excuse the slow offence</line>
    <line n="698">Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:</line>
    <line n="699">From where thou art why should I haste me thence?</line>
    <line n="700">Till I return, of posting is no need.</line>
    <line n="701">O! what excuse will my poor beast then find,</line>
    <line n="702">When swift extremity can seem but slow?</line>
    <line n="703">Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind,</line>
    <line n="704">In winged speed no motion shall I know,</line>
    <line n="705">Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;</line>
    <line n="706">Therefore desire, of perfect'st love being made,</line>
    <line n="707">Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;</line>
    <line n="708">But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade,--</line> 'Since from thee going, he went
    wilful-slow, <line n="709">Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.'</line>
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="710">So am I as the rich, whose blessed key,</line>
    <line n="711">Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,</line>
    <line n="712">The which he will not every hour survey,</line>
    <line n="713">For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.</line>
    <line n="714">Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,</line>
    <line n="715">Since, seldom coming in that long year set,</line>
    <line n="716">Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,</line>
    <line n="717">Or captain jewels in the carcanet.</line>
    <line n="718">So is the time that keeps you as my chest,</line>
    <line n="719">Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,</line>
    <line n="720">To make some special instant special-blest,</line>
    <line n="721">By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.</line>
    <line n="722">Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope,</line>
    <line n="723">Being had, to triumph; being lacked, to hope.</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="724">What is your substance, whereof are you made,</line>
    <line n="725">That millions of strange shadows on you tend?</line>
    <line n="726">Since every one, hath every one, one shade,</line>
    <line n="727">And you but one, can every shadow lend.</line>
    <line n="728">Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit</line>
    <line n="729">Is poorly imitated after you;</line>
    <line n="730">On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,</line>
    <line n="731">And you in Grecian tires are painted new:</line>
    <line n="732">Speak of the spring, and foison of the year,</line>
    <line n="733">The one doth shadow of your beauty show,</line>
    <line n="734">The other as your bounty doth appear;</line>
    <line n="735">And you in every blessed shape we know.</line>
    <line n="736">In all external grace you have some part,</line>
    <line n="737">But you like none, none you, for constant heart.</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="738">O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem</line>
    <line n="739">By that sweet ornament which truth doth give.</line>
    <line n="740">The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem</line>
    <line n="741">For that sweet odour, which doth in it live.</line>
    <line n="742">The canker blooms have full as deep a dye</line>
    <line n="743">As the perfumed tincture of the roses.</line>
    <line n="744">Hang on such thorns, and play as wantonly</line>
    <line n="745">When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:</line>
    <line n="746">But, for their virtue only is their show,</line>
    <line n="747">They live unwoo'd, and unrespected fade;</line>
    <line n="748">Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;</line>
    <line n="749">Of their sweet deaths, are sweetest odours made:</line>
    <line n="750">And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,</line>
    <line n="751">When that shall vade, by verse distills your truth.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="752">Not marble, nor the gilded monuments</line>
    <line n="753">Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;</line>
    <line n="754">But you shall shine more bright in these contents</line>
    <line n="755">Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.</line>
    <line n="756">When wasteful war shall statues overturn,</line>
    <line n="757">And broils root out the work of masonry,</line>
    <line n="758">Nor Mars his sword, nor war's quick fire shall burn</line>
    <line n="759">The living record of your memory.</line>
    <line n="760">'Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity</line>
    <line n="761">Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room</line>
    <line n="762">Even in the eyes of all posterity</line>
    <line n="763">That wear this world out to the ending doom.</line>
    <line n="764">So, till the judgment that yourself arise,</line>
    <line n="765">You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.</line>
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="766">Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said</line>
    <line n="767">Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,</line>
    <line n="768">Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,</line>
    <line n="769">To-morrow sharpened in his former might:</line>
    <line n="770">So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill</line>
    <line n="771">Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fulness,</line>
    <line n="772">To-morrow see again, and do not kill</line>
    <line n="773">The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.</line>
    <line n="774">Let this sad interim like the ocean be</line>
    <line n="775">Which parts the shore, where two contracted new</line>
    <line n="776">Come daily to the banks, that when they see</line>
    <line n="777">Return of love, more blest may be the view;</line>
    <line n="778">Or call it winter, which being full of care,</line>
    <line n="779">Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="780">Being your slave what should I do but tend,</line>
    <line n="781">Upon the hours, and times of your desire?</line>
    <line n="782">I have no precious time at all to spend;</line>
    <line n="783">Nor services to do, till you require.</line>
    <line n="784">Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,</line>
    <line n="785">Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,</line>
    <line n="786">Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,</line>
    <line n="787">When you have bid your servant once adieu;</line>
    <line n="788">Nor dare I question with my jealous thought</line>
    <line n="789">Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,</line>
    <line n="790">But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought</line>
    <line n="791">Save, where you are, how happy you make those.</line>
    <line n="792">So true a fool is love, that in your will,</line>
    <line n="793">Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="794">That god forbid, that made me first your slave,</line>
    <line n="795">I should in thought control your times of pleasure,</line>

    <line n="797">Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!</line>
    <line n="798">O! let me suffer, being at your beck,</line>
    <line n="799">The imprison'd absence of your liberty;</line>
    <line n="800">And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,</line>
    <line n="801">Without accusing you of injury.</line>
    <line n="802">Be where you list, your charter is so strong</line>
    <line n="803">That you yourself may privilage your time</line>
    <line n="804">To what you will; to you it doth belong</line>
    <line n="805">Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.</line>
    <line n="806">I am to wait, though waiting so be hell,</line>
    <line n="807">Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well.</line>

    <line n="808">If there be nothing new, but that which is</line>

    <line n="811">The second burthen of a former child!</line>
    <line n="812">O! that record could with a backward look,</line>
    <line n="813">Even of five hundred courses of the sun,</line>
    <line n="814">Show me your image in some antique book,</line>
    <line n="815">Since mind at first in character was done!</line>
    <line n="816">That I might see what the old world could say</line>
    <line n="817">To this composed wonder of your frame;</line>
    <line n="818">Wh'r we are mended, or wh'r better they,</line>
    <line n="819">Or whether revolution be the same.</line>
    <line n="820">O! sure I am the wits of former days,</line>
    <line n="821">To subjects worse have given admiring praise.</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="822">Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,</line>

    <line n="824">Each changing place with that which goes before,</line>
    <line n="825">In sequent toil all forwards do contend.</line>
    <line n="826">Nativity, once in the main of light,</line>
    <line n="827">Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,</line>
    <line n="828">Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight,</line>
    <line n="829">And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.</line>
    <line n="830">Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth</line>
    <line n="831">And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,</line>
    <line n="832">Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,</line>
    <line n="833">And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:</line>
    <line n="834">And yet to times in hope, my verse shall stand.</line>
    <line n="835">Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.</line>

    <line n="836">Is it thy will, thy image should keep open</line>

    <line n="839">While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?</line>
    <line n="840">Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee</line>
    <line n="841">So far from home into my deeds to pry,</line>
    <line n="842">To find out shames and idle hours in me,</line>
    <line n="843">The scope and tenure of thy jealousy?</line>
    <line n="844">O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:</line>
    <line n="845">It is my love that keeps mine eye awake:</line>
    <line n="846">Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,</line>
    <line n="847">To play the watchman ever for thy sake:</line>
    <line n="848">For thee watch I, whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,</line>

    <line n="850">Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye</line>

    <line n="854">Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,</line>
    <line n="855">No shape so true, no truth of such account;</line>
    <line n="856">And for myself mine own worth do define,</line>

    <line n="869">And all those beauties whereof now he's king</line>
    <line n="870">Are vanishing, or vanished out of sight,</line>

    <line n="873">Against confounding age's cruel knife,</line>

    <line n="875">My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:</line>
    <line n="876">His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="878">When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd</line>
    <line n="879">The rich-proud cost of outworn buried age;</line>
    <line n="880">When sometime lofty towers I see down-raz'd,</line>
    <line n="881">And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;</line>
    <line n="882">When I have seen the hungry ocean gain</line>
    <line n="883">Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,</line>
    <line n="884">And the firm soil win of the watery main,</line>
    <line n="885">Increasing store with loss, and loss with store;</line>
    <line n="886">When I have seen such interchange of state,</line>
    <line n="887">Or state itself confounded, to decay;</line>
    <line n="888">Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate--</line>
    <line n="889">That Time will come and take my love away.</line>
    <line n="890">This thought is as a death which cannot choose</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="892">Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,</line>

    <line n="895">Whose action is no stronger than a flower?</line>
    <line n="896">O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,</line>
    <line n="897">Against the wrackful siege of battering days,</line>
    <line n="898">When rocks impregnable are not so stout,</line>
    <line n="899">Nor gates of steel so strong but Time decays?</line>
    <line n="900">O fearful meditation! where, alack,</line>
    <line n="901">Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?</line>
    <line n="902">Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?</line>
    <line n="903">Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?</line>
    <line n="904">O! none, unless this miracle have might,</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="906">Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,</line>

    <line n="909">And purest faith unhappily forsworn,</line>
    <line n="910">And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,</line>

    <line n="928">Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,</line>
    <line n="929">Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?</line>
    <line n="930">For she hath no exchequer now but his,</line>
    <line n="931">And proud of many, lives upon his gains.</line>
    <line n="932">O! him she stores, to show what wealth she had</line>
    <line n="933">In days long since, before these last so bad.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="934">Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,</line>
    <line n="935">When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,</line>
    <line n="936">Before these bastard signs of fair were born,</line>
    <line n="937">Or durst inhabit on a living brow;</line>
    <line n="938">Before the golden tresses of the dead,</line>
    <line n="939">The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,</line>
    <line n="940">To live a second life on second head;</line>
    <line n="941">Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:</line>
    <line n="942">In him those holy antique hours are seen,</line>
    <line n="943">Without all ornament, itself and true,</line>
    <line n="944">Making no summer of another's green,</line>
    <line n="945">Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;</line>
    <line n="946">And him as for a map doth Nature store,</line>
    <line n="947">To show false Art what beauty was of yore.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="948">Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view</line>
    <line n="949">Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;</line>
    <line n="950">All tongues--the voice of souls--give thee that due,</line>
    <line n="951">Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.</line>
    <line n="952">Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;</line>
    <line n="953">But those same tongues, that give thee so thine own,</line>
    <line n="954">In other accents do this praise confound</line>
    <line n="955">By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.</line>
    <line n="956">They look into the beauty of thy mind,</line>
    <line n="957">And that in guess they measure by thy deeds;</line>
    <line n="958">Then--churls--their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,</line>
    <line n="959">To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:</line>
    <line n="960">But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,</line>
    <line n="961">The soil is this, that thou dost common grow.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="962">That thou art blam'd shall not be thy defect,</line>
    <line n="963">For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;</line>
    <line n="964">The ornament of beauty is suspect,</line>
    <line n="965">A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.</line>
    <line n="966">So thou be good, slander doth but approve</line>
    <line n="967">Thy worth the greater being woo'd of time;</line>
    <line n="968">For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,</line>
    <line n="969">And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.</line>
    <line n="970">Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days</line>
    <line n="971">Either not assail'd, or victor being charg'd;</line>
    <line n="972">Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,</line>
    <line n="973">To tie up envy, evermore enlarg'd,</line>
    <line n="974">If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,</line>
    <line n="975">Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="976">No longer mourn for me when I am dead</line>
    <line n="977">Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell</line>
    <line n="978">Give warning to the world that I am fled</line>
    <line n="979">From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell:</line>
    <line n="980">Nay, if you read this line, remember not</line>
    <line n="981">The hand that writ it, for I love you so,</line>
    <line n="982">That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,</line>
    <line n="983">If thinking on me then should make you woe.</line>
    <line n="984">O! if,--I say you look upon this verse,</line>
    <line n="985">When I perhaps compounded am with clay,</line>
    <line n="986">Do not so much as my poor name rehearse;</line>
    <line n="987">But let your love even with my life decay;</line>
    <line n="988">Lest the wise world should look into your moan,</line>
    <line n="989">And mock you with me after I am gone.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="990">O! lest the world should task you to recite</line>
    <line n="991">What merit lived in me, that you should love</line>
    <line n="992">After my death,--dear love, forget me quite,</line>
    <line n="993">For you in me can nothing worthy prove;</line>
    <line n="994">Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,</line>
    <line n="995">To do more for me than mine own desert,</line>
    <line n="996">And hang more praise upon deceased I</line>
    <line n="997">Than niggard truth would willingly impart:</line>
    <line n="998">O! lest your true love may seem false in this</line>
    <line n="999">That you for love speak well of me untrue,</line>
    <line n="1000">My name be buried where my body is,</line>
    <line n="1001">And live no more to shame nor me nor you.</line>
    <line n="1002">For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,</line>
    <line n="1003">And so should you, to love things nothing worth.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1004">That time of year thou mayst in me behold</line>
    <line n="1005">When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang</line>
    <line n="1006">Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,</line>
    <line n="1007">Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.</line>
    <line n="1008">In me thou see'st the twilight of such day</line>
    <line n="1009">As after sunset fadeth in the west;</line>
    <line n="1010">Which by and by black night doth take away,</line>
    <line n="1011">Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.</line>
    <line n="1012">In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,</line>
    <line n="1013">That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,</line>
    <line n="1014">As the death-bed, whereon it must expire,</line>
    <line n="1015">Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.</line>
    <line n="1016">This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,</line>
    <line n="1017">To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1018">But be contented: when that fell arrest</line>
    <line n="1019">Without all bail shall carry me away,</line>
    <line n="1020">My life hath in this line some interest,</line>
    <line n="1021">Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.</line>
    <line n="1022">When thou reviewest this, thou dost review</line>
    <line n="1023">The very part was consecrate to thee:</line>
    <line n="1024">The earth can have but earth, which is his due;</line>
    <line n="1025">My spirit is thine, the better part of me:</line>
    <line n="1026">So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,</line>
    <line n="1027">The prey of worms, my body being dead;</line>
    <line n="1028">The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,</line>
    <line n="1029">Too base of thee to be remembered.</line>
    <line n="1030">The worth of that is that which it contains,</line>
    <line n="1031">And that is this, and this with thee remains.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1032">So are you to my thoughts as food to life,</line>
    <line n="1033">Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;</line>
    <line n="1034">And for the peace of you I hold such strife</line>
    <line n="1035">As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found.</line>
    <line n="1036">Now proud as an enjoyer, and anon</line>
    <line n="1037">Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure;</line>
    <line n="1038">Now counting best to be with you alone,</line>
    <line n="1039">Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure:</line>
    <line n="1040">Sometime all full with feasting on your sight,</line>
    <line n="1041">And by and by clean starved for a look;</line>
    <line n="1042">Possessing or pursuing no delight,</line>
    <line n="1043">Save what is had, or must from you be took.</line>
    <line n="1044">Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,</line>
    <line n="1045">Or gluttoning on all, or all away.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1046">Why is my verse so barren of new pride,</line>
    <line n="1047">So far from variation or quick change?</line>
    <line n="1048">Why with the time do I not glance aside</line>
    <line n="1049">To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?</line>
    <line n="1050">Why write I still all one, ever the same,</line>
    <line n="1051">And keep invention in a noted weed,</line>
    <line n="1052">That every word doth almost tell my name,</line>
    <line n="1053">Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?</line>
    <line n="1054">O! know sweet love I always write of you,</line>
    <line n="1055">And you and love are still my argument;</line>
    <line n="1056">So all my best is dressing old words new,</line>
    <line n="1057">Spending again what is already spent:</line>
    <line n="1058">For as the sun is daily new and old,</line>
    <line n="1059">So is my love still telling what is told.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1060">Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,</line>
    <line n="1061">Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;</line>
    <line n="1062">These vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,</line>
    <line n="1063">And of this book, this learning mayst thou taste.</line>
    <line n="1064">The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show</line>
    <line n="1065">Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;</line>
    <line n="1066">Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know</line>
    <line n="1067">Time's thievish progress to eternity.</line>
    <line n="1068">Look! what thy memory cannot contain,</line>
    <line n="1069">Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find</line>
    <line n="1070">Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,</line>
    <line n="1071">To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.</line>
    <line n="1072">These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,</line>
    <line n="1073">Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1074">So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse,</line>
    <line n="1075">And found such fair assistance in my verse</line>
    <line n="1076">As every alien pen hath got my use</line>
    <line n="1077">And under thee their poesy disperse.</line>
    <line n="1078">Thine eyes, that taught the dumb on high to sing</line>
    <line n="1079">And heavy ignorance aloft to fly,</line>
    <line n="1080">Have added feathers to the learned's wing</line>
    <line n="1081">And given grace a double majesty.</line>
    <line n="1082">Yet be most proud of that which I compile,</line>
    <line n="1083">Whose influence is thine, and born of thee:</line>
    <line n="1084">In others' works thou dost but mend the style,</line>
    <line n="1085">And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;</line>
    <line n="1086">But thou art all my art, and dost advance</line>
    <line n="1087">As high as learning, my rude ignorance.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1088">Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,</line>
    <line n="1089">My verse alone had all thy gentle grace;</line>
    <line n="1090">But now my gracious numbers are decay'd,</line>
    <line n="1091">And my sick Muse doth give an other place.</line>
    <line n="1092">I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument</line>
    <line n="1093">Deserves the travail of a worthier pen;</line>
    <line n="1094">Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent</line>
    <line n="1095">He robs thee of, and pays it thee again.</line>
    <line n="1096">He lends thee virtue, and he stole that word</line>
    <line n="1097">From thy behaviour; beauty doth he give,</line>
    <line n="1098">And found it in thy cheek: he can afford</line>
    <line n="1099">No praise to thee, but what in thee doth live.</line>
    <line n="1100">Then thank him not for that which he doth say,</line>
    <line n="1101">Since what he owes thee, thou thyself dost pay.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1102">O! how I faint when I of you do write,</line>
    <line n="1103">Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,</line>
    <line n="1104">And in the praise thereof spends all his might,</line>
    <line n="1105">To make me tongue-tied speaking of your fame!</line>
    <line n="1106">But since your worth--wide as the ocean is,--</line>
    <line n="1107">The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,</line>
    <line n="1108">My saucy bark, inferior far to his,</line>
    <line n="1109">On your broad main doth wilfully appear.</line>
    <line n="1110">Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,</line>
    <line n="1111">Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;</line>
    <line n="1112">Or, being wrack'd, I am a worthless boat,</line>
    <line n="1113">He of tall building, and of goodly pride:</line>
    <line n="1114">Then if he thrive and I be cast away,</line>
    <line n="1115">The worst was this,--my love was my decay.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1116">Or I shall live your epitaph to make,</line>
    <line n="1117">Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;</line>
    <line n="1118">From hence your memory death cannot take,</line>
    <line n="1119">Although in me each part will be forgotten.</line>
    <line n="1120">Your name from hence immortal life shall have,</line>
    <line n="1121">Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:</line>
    <line n="1122">The earth can yield me but a common grave,</line>
    <line n="1123">When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.</line>
    <line n="1124">Your monument shall be my gentle verse,</line>
    <line n="1125">Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;</line>
    <line n="1126">And tongues to be, your being shall rehearse,</line>
    <line n="1127">When all the breathers of this world are dead;</line>
    <line n="1128">You still shall live,--such virtue hath my pen,--</line>
    <line n="1129">Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1130">I grant thou wert not married to my Muse,</line>
    <line n="1131">And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook</line>
    <line n="1132">The dedicated words which writers use</line>
    <line n="1133">Of their fair subject, blessing every book.</line>
    <line n="1134">Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,</line>
    <line n="1135">Finding thy worth a limit past my praise;</line>
    <line n="1136">And therefore art enforced to seek anew</line>
    <line n="1137">Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days.</line>
    <line n="1138">And do so, love; yet when they have devis'd,</line>
    <line n="1139">What strained touches rhetoric can lend,</line>
    <line n="1140">Thou truly fair, wert truly sympathiz'd</line>
    <line n="1141">In true plain words, by thy true-telling friend;</line>
    <line n="1142">And their gross painting might be better us'd</line>
    <line n="1143">Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abus'd.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1144">I never saw that you did painting need,</line>
    <line n="1145">And therefore to your fair no painting set;</line>
    <line n="1146">I found, or thought I found, you did exceed</line>
    <line n="1147">That barren tender of a poet's debt:</line>
    <line n="1148">And therefore have I slept in your report,</line>
    <line n="1149">That you yourself, being extant, well might show</line>
    <line n="1150">How far a modern quill doth come too short,</line>
    <line n="1151">Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.</line>
    <line n="1152">This silence for my sin you did impute,</line>
    <line n="1153">Which shall be most my glory being dumb;</line>
    <line n="1154">For I impair not beauty being mute,</line>
    <line n="1155">When others would give life, and bring a tomb.</line>
    <line n="1156">There lives more life in one of your fair eyes</line>
    <line n="1157">Than both your poets can in praise devise.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1158">Who is it that says most, which can say more,</line>
    <line n="1159">Than this rich praise,--that you alone, are you?</line>
    <line n="1160">In whose confine immured is the store</line>
    <line n="1161">Which should example where your equal grew.</line>
    <line n="1162">Lean penury within that pen doth dwell</line>
    <line n="1163">That to his subject lends not some small glory;</line>
    <line n="1164">But he that writes of you, if he can tell</line>
    <line n="1165">That you are you, so dignifies his story,</line>
    <line n="1166">Let him but copy what in you is writ,</line>
    <line n="1167">Not making worse what nature made so clear,</line>
    <line n="1168">And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,</line>
    <line n="1169">Making his style admired every where.</line>
    <line n="1170">You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,</line>
    <line n="1171">Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1172">My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,</line>
    <line n="1173">While comments of your praise richly compil'd,</line>
    <line n="1174">Reserve their character with golden quill,</line>
    <line n="1175">And precious phrase by all the Muses fil'd.</line>
    <line n="1176">I think good thoughts, whilst others write good words,</line>
    <line n="1177">And like unlettered clerk still cry 'Amen'</line>
    <line n="1178">To every hymn that able spirit affords,</line>
    <line n="1179">In polish'd form of well-refined pen.</line>
    <line n="1180">Hearing you praised, I say ''tis so, 'tis true,'</line>
    <line n="1181">And to the most of praise add something more;</line>
    <line n="1182">But that is in my thought, whose love to you,</line>
    <line n="1183">Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.</line>
    <line n="1184">Then others, for the breath of words respect,</line>
    <line n="1185">Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1186">Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,</line>
    <line n="1187">Bound for the prize of all too precious you,</line>
    <line n="1188">That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,</line>
    <line n="1189">Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?</line>
    <line n="1190">Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write,</line>
    <line n="1191">Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?</line>
    <line n="1192">No, neither he, nor his compeers by night</line>
    <line n="1193">Giving him aid, my verse astonished.</line>
    <line n="1194">He, nor that affable familiar ghost</line>
    <line n="1195">Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,</line>
    <line n="1196">As victors of my silence cannot boast;</line>
    <line n="1197">I was not sick of any fear from thence:</line>
    <line n="1198">But when your countenance fill'd up his line,</line>
    <line n="1199">Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1200">Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,</line>
    <line n="1201">And like enough thou know'st thy estimate,</line>
    <line n="1202">The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;</line>
    <line n="1203">My bonds in thee are all determinate.</line>
    <line n="1204">For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?</line>
    <line n="1205">And for that riches where is my deserving?</line>
    <line n="1206">The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,</line>
    <line n="1207">And so my patent back again is swerving.</line>
    <line n="1208">Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,</line>
    <line n="1209">Or me to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;</line>
    <line n="1210">So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,</line>
    <line n="1211">Comes home again, on better judgement making.</line>
    <line n="1212">Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,</line>
    <line n="1213">In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1214">When thou shalt be dispos'd to set me light,</line>
    <line n="1215">And place my merit in the eye of scorn,</line>
    <line n="1216">Upon thy side, against myself I'll fight,</line>
    <line n="1217">And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.</line>
    <line n="1218">With mine own weakness, being best acquainted,</line>
    <line n="1219">Upon thy part I can set down a story</line>
    <line n="1220">Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted;</line>
    <line n="1221">That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:</line>
    <line n="1222">And I by this will be a gainer too;</line>
    <line n="1223">For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,</line>
    <line n="1224">The injuries that to myself I do,</line>
    <line n="1225">Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.</line>
    <line n="1226">Such is my love, to thee I so belong,</line>

    <line n="1230">Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,</line>
    <line n="1231">Against thy reasons making no defence.</line>
    <line n="1232">Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill,</line>
    <line n="1233">To set a form upon desired change,</line>
    <line n="1234">As I'll myself disgrace; knowing thy will,</line>
    <line n="1235">I will acquaintance strangle, and look strange;</line>
    <line n="1236">Be absent from thy walks; and in my tongue</line>
    <line n="1237">Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,</line>
    <line n="1238">Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong,</line>
    <line n="1239">And haply of our old acquaintance tell.</line>
    <line n="1240">For thee, against my self I'll vow debate,</line>
    <line n="1241">For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1242">Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;</line>
    <line n="1243">Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,</line>
    <line n="1244">Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,</line>
    <line n="1245">And do not drop in for an after-loss:</line>
    <line n="1246">Ah! do not, when my heart hath 'scap'd this sorrow,</line>
    <line n="1247">Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;</line>
    <line n="1248">Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,</line>
    <line n="1249">To linger out a purpos'd overthrow.</line>
    <line n="1250">If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,</line>
    <line n="1251">When other petty griefs have done their spite,</line>
    <line n="1252">But in the onset come: so shall I taste</line>
    <line n="1253">At first the very worst of fortune's might;</line>
    <line n="1254">And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,</line>
    <line n="1255">Compar'd with loss of thee, will not seem so.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1256">Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,</line>
    <line n="1257">Some in their wealth, some in their body's force,</line>
    <line n="1258">Some in their garments though new-fangled ill;</line>
    <line n="1259">Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;</line>
    <line n="1260">And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,</line>
    <line n="1261">Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:</line>
    <line n="1262">But these particulars are not my measure,</line>
    <line n="1263">All these I better in one general best.</line>
    <line n="1264">Thy love is better than high birth to me,</line>
    <line n="1265">Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' costs,</line>
    <line n="1266">Of more delight than hawks and horses be;</line>
    <line n="1267">And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:</line>
    <line n="1268">Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take</line>
    <line n="1269">All this away, and me most wretchcd make.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1270">But do thy worst to steal thyself away,</line>
    <line n="1271">For term of life thou art assured mine;</line>
    <line n="1272">And life no longer than thy love will stay,</line>
    <line n="1273">For it depends upon that love of thine.</line>
    <line n="1274">Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,</line>
    <line n="1275">When in the least of them my life hath end.</line>
    <line n="1276">I see a better state to me belongs</line>
    <line n="1277">Than that which on thy humour doth depend:</line>
    <line n="1278">Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,</line>
    <line n="1279">Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.</line>
    <line n="1280">O! what a happy title do I find,</line>
    <line n="1281">Happy to have thy love, happy to die!</line>
    <line n="1282">But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?</line>
    <line n="1283">Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1284">So shall I live, supposing thou art true,</line>
    <line n="1285">Like a deceived husband; so love's face</line>
    <line n="1286">May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;</line>
    <line n="1287">Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:</line>
    <line n="1288">For there can live no hatred in thine eye,</line>
    <line n="1289">Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.</line>
    <line n="1290">In many's looks, the false heart's history</line>
    <line n="1291">Is writ in moods, and frowns, and wrinkles strange.</line>
    <line n="1292">But heaven in thy creation did decree</line>
    <line n="1293">That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;</line>
    <line n="1294">Whate'er thy thoughts, or thy heart's workings be,</line>
    <line n="1295">Thy looks should nothing thence, but sweetness tell.</line>
    <line n="1296">How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,</line>
    <line n="1297">If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1298">They that have power to hurt, and will do none,</line>
    <line n="1299">That do not do the thing they most do show,</line>
    <line n="1300">Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,</line>
    <line n="1301">Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow;</line>
    <line n="1302">They rightly do inherit heaven's graces,</line>
    <line n="1303">And husband nature's riches from expense;</line>
    <line n="1304">They are the lords and owners of their faces,</line>
    <line n="1305">Others, but stewards of their excellence.</line>
    <line n="1306">The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,</line>
    <line n="1307">Though to itself, it only live and die,</line>
    <line n="1308">But if that flower with base infection meet,</line>
    <line n="1309">The basest weed outbraves his dignity:</line>

    <line n="1311">Lilies that fester, smell far worse than weeds.</line>

    <line n="1312">How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame</line>
    <line n="1313">Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,</line>

    <line n="1315">O! in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose.</line>
    <line n="1316">That tongue that tells the story of thy days,</line>
    <line n="1317">Making lascivious comments on thy sport,</line>
    <line n="1318">Cannot dispraise, but in a kind of praise;</line>
    <line n="1319">Naming thy name, blesses an ill report.</line>
    <line n="1320">O! what a mansion have those vices got</line>
    <line n="1321">Which for their habitation chose out thee,</line>
    <line n="1322">Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot</line>
    <line n="1323">And all things turns to fair that eyes can see!</line>
    <line n="1324">Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;</line>
    <line n="1325">The hardest knife ill-us'd doth lose his edge.</line>

    <line n="1326">Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;</line>
    <line n="1327">Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;</line>
    <line n="1328">Both grace and faults are lov'd of more and less:</line>
    <line n="1329">Thou mak'st faults graces that to thee resort.</line>
    <line n="1330">As on the finger of a throned queen</line>
    <line n="1331">The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,</line>
    <line n="1332">So are those errors that in thee are seen</line>
    <line n="1333">To truths translated, and for true things deem'd.</line>
    <line n="1334">How many lambs might the stern wolf betray,</line>
    <line n="1335">If like a lamb he could his looks translate!</line>
    <line n="1336">How many gazers mightst thou lead away,</line>
    <line n="1337">if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!</line>
    <line n="1338">But do not so; I love thee in such sort,</line>
    <line n="1339">As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="1340">How like a winter hath my absence been</line>
    <line n="1341">From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!</line>
    <line n="1342">What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!</line>
    <line n="1343">What old December's bareness everywhere!</line>
    <line n="1344">And yet this time removed was summer's time;</line>
    <line n="1345">The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,</line>
    <line n="1346">Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,</line>
    <line n="1347">Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:</line>
    <line n="1348">Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me</line>
    <line n="1349">But hope of orphans, and unfather'd fruit;</line>
    <line n="1350">For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,</line>
    <line n="1351">And, thou away, the very birds are mute:</line>
    <line n="1352">Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer,</line>
    <line n="1353">That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1354">From you have I been absent in the spring,</line>
    <line n="1355">When proud-pied April, dress'd in all his trim,</line>
    <line n="1356">Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,</line>
    <line n="1357">That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.</line>
    <line n="1358">Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell</line>
    <line n="1359">Of different flowers in odour and in hue,</line>
    <line n="1360">Could make me any summer's story tell,</line>
    <line n="1361">Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:</line>
    <line n="1362">Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,</line>
    <line n="1363">Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;</line>
    <line n="1364">They were but sweet, but figures of delight,</line>
    <line n="1365">Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.</line>
    <line n="1366">Yet seem'd it winter still, and you away,</line>
    <line n="1367">As with your shadow I with these did play.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1368">The forward violet thus did I chide:</line>
    <line n="1369">Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,</line>
    <line n="1370">If not from my love's breath? The purple pride</line>
    <line n="1371">Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells</line>
    <line n="1372">In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dy'd.</line>
    <line n="1373">The lily I condemned for thy hand,</line>
    <line n="1374">And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair;</line>
    <line n="1375">The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,</line>
    <line n="1376">One blushing shame, another white despair;</line>
    <line n="1377">A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both,</line>
    <line n="1378">And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;</line>
    <line n="1379">But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth</line>
    <line n="1380">A vengeful canker eat him up to death.</line>
    <line n="1381">More flowers I noted, yet I none could see,</line>
    <line n="1382">But sweet, or colour it had stol'n from thee.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1383">Where art thou Muse that thou forget'st so long,</line>
    <line n="1384">To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?</line>
    <line n="1385">Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,</line>
    <line n="1386">Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?</line>
    <line n="1387">Return forgetful Muse, and straight redeem,</line>
    <line n="1388">In gentle numbers time so idly spent;</line>
    <line n="1389">Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem</line>
    <line n="1390">And gives thy pen both skill and argument.</line>
    <line n="1391">Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,</line>
    <line n="1392">If Time have any wrinkle graven there;</line>
    <line n="1393">If any, be a satire to decay,</line>
    <line n="1394">And make time's spoils despised every where.</line>
    <line n="1395">Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life,</line>
    <line n="1396">So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1397">O truant Muse what shall be thy amends</line>
    <line n="1398">For thy neglect of truth in beauty dy'd?</line>
    <line n="1399">Both truth and beauty on my love depends;</line>
    <line n="1400">So dost thou too, and therein dignified.</line>
    <line n="1401">Make answer Muse: wilt thou not haply say,</line> 'Truth needs no colour, with his colour
    fix'd; <line n="1402">Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;</line>
    <line n="1403">But best is best, if never intermix'd'?</line>
    <line n="1404">Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?</line>
    <line n="1405">Excuse not silence so, for't lies in thee</line>
    <line n="1406">To make him much outlive a gilded tomb</line>
    <line n="1407">And to be prais'd of ages yet to be.</line>
    <line n="1408">Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how</line>
    <line n="1409">To make him seem long hence as he shows now.</line>
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1410">My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;</line>
    <line n="1411">I love not less, though less the show appear;</line>
    <line n="1412">That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,</line>
    <line n="1413">The owner's tongue doth publish every where.</line>
    <line n="1414">Our love was new, and then but in the spring,</line>
    <line n="1415">When I was wont to greet it with my lays;</line>
    <line n="1416">As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,</line>
    <line n="1417">And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:</line>
    <line n="1418">Not that the summer is less pleasant now</line>
    <line n="1419">Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,</line>
    <line n="1420">But that wild music burthens every bough,</line>
    <line n="1421">And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.</line>
    <line n="1422">Therefore like her, I sometime hold my tongue:</line>
    <line n="1423">Because I would not dull you with my song.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1424">Alack! what poverty my Muse brings forth,</line>
    <line n="1425">That having such a scope to show her pride,</line>
    <line n="1426">The argument, all bare, is of more worth</line>
    <line n="1427">Than when it hath my added praise beside!</line>
    <line n="1428">O! blame me not, if I no more can write!</line>
    <line n="1429">Look in your glass, and there appears a face</line>
    <line n="1430">That over-goes my blunt invention quite,</line>
    <line n="1431">Dulling my lines, and doing me disgrace.</line>
    <line n="1432">Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,</line>
    <line n="1433">To mar the subject that before was well?</line>
    <line n="1434">For to no other pass my verses tend</line>
    <line n="1435">Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;</line>
    <line n="1436">And more, much more, than in my verse can sit,</line>
    <line n="1437">Your own glass shows you when you look in it.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1438">To me, fair friend, you never can be old,</line>
    <line n="1439">For as you were when first your eye I ey'd,</line>
    <line n="1440">Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,</line>
    <line n="1441">Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,</line>
    <line n="1442">Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd,</line>
    <line n="1443">In process of the seasons have I seen,</line>
    <line n="1444">Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,</line>
    <line n="1445">Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.</line>
    <line n="1446">Ah! yet doth beauty like a dial-hand,</line>
    <line n="1447">Steal from his figure, and no pace perceiv'd;</line>
    <line n="1448">So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,</line>
    <line n="1449">Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceiv'd:</line>
    <line n="1450">For fear of which, hear this thou age unbred:</line>
    <line n="1451">Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1452">Let not my love be call'd idolatry,</line>
    <line n="1453">Nor my beloved as an idol show,</line>
    <line n="1454">Since all alike my songs and praises be</line>
    <line n="1455">To one, of one, still such, and ever so.</line>
    <line n="1456">Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,</line>
    <line n="1457">Still constant in a wondrous excellence;</line>
    <line n="1458">Therefore my verse to constancy confin'd,</line>
    <line n="1459">One thing expressing, leaves out difference.</line> 'Fair, kind, and true,' is all my
    argument, 'Fair, kind, and true,' varying to other words; <line n="1460">And in this change is my
      invention spent,</line>
    <line n="1461">Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.</line>
    <line n="1462">Fair, kind, and true, have often liv'd alone,</line>
    <line n="1463">Which three till now, never kept seat in one.</line>
  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1464">When in the chronicle of wasted time</line>
    <line n="1465">I see descriptions of the fairest wights,</line>
    <line n="1466">And beauty making beautiful old rime,</line>
    <line n="1467">In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,</line>
    <line n="1468">Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,</line>
    <line n="1469">Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,</line>
    <line n="1470">I see their antique pen would have express'd</line>
    <line n="1471">Even such a beauty as you master now.</line>
    <line n="1472">So all their praises are but prophecies</line>
    <line n="1473">Of this our time, all you prefiguring;</line>
    <line n="1474">And for they looked but with divining eyes,</line>
    <line n="1475">They had not skill enough your worth to sing:</line>
    <line n="1476">For we, which now behold these present days,</line>
    <line n="1477">Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1478">Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul</line>
    <line n="1479">Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,</line>
    <line n="1480">Can yet the lease of my true love control,</line>
    <line n="1481">Supposed as forfeit to a confin'd doom.</line>
    <line n="1482">The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,</line>
    <line n="1483">And the sad augurs mock their own presage;</line>
    <line n="1484">Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,</line>
    <line n="1485">And peace proclaims olives of endless age.</line>
    <line n="1486">Now with the drops of this most balmy time,</line>
    <line n="1487">My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,</line>
    <line n="1488">Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rime,</line>
    <line n="1489">While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:</line>
    <line n="1490">And thou in this shalt find thy monument,</line>
    <line n="1491">When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1492">What's in the brain, that ink may character,</line>
    <line n="1493">Which hath not figur'd to thee my true spirit?</line>
    <line n="1494">What's new to speak, what now to register,</line>
    <line n="1495">That may express my love, or thy dear merit?</line>
    <line n="1496">Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,</line>
    <line n="1497">I must each day say o'er the very same;</line>
    <line n="1498">Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,</line>
    <line n="1499">Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.</line>
    <line n="1500">So that eternal love in love's fresh case,</line>
    <line n="1501">Weighs not the dust and injury of age,</line>
    <line n="1502">Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,</line>
    <line n="1503">But makes antiquity for aye his page;</line>
    <line n="1504">Finding the first conceit of love there bred,</line>
    <line n="1505">Where time and outward form would show it dead.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1506">O! never say that I was false of heart,</line>
    <line n="1507">Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify,</line>
    <line n="1508">As easy might I from my self depart</line>
    <line n="1509">As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie:</line>
    <line n="1510">That is my home of love: if I have rang'd,</line>
    <line n="1511">Like him that travels, I return again;</line>
    <line n="1512">Just to the time, not with the time exchang'd,</line>
    <line n="1513">So that myself bring water for my stain.</line>
    <line n="1514">Never believe though in my nature reign'd,</line>
    <line n="1515">All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,</line>
    <line n="1516">That it could so preposterously be stain'd,</line>
    <line n="1517">To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;</line>
    <line n="1518">For nothing this wide universe I call,</line>
    <line n="1519">Save thou, my rose, in it thou art my all.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1520">Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,</line>
    <line n="1521">And made my self a motley to the view,</line>
    <line n="1522">Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,</line>
    <line n="1523">Made old offences of affections new;</line>
    <line n="1524">Most true it is, that I have look'd on truth</line>
    <line n="1525">Askance and strangely; but, by all above,</line>
    <line n="1526">These blenches gave my heart another youth,</line>
    <line n="1527">And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.</line>
    <line n="1528">Now all is done, save what shall have no end:</line>
    <line n="1529">Mine appetite I never more will grind</line>
    <line n="1530">On newer proof, to try an older friend,</line>
    <line n="1531">A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.</line>
    <line n="1532">Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,</line>
    <line n="1533">Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="1534">O! for my sake do you with Fortune chide,</line>
    <line n="1535">The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,</line>
    <line n="1536">That did not better for my life provide</line>
    <line n="1537">Than public means which public manners breeds.</line>
    <line n="1538">Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,</line>
    <line n="1539">And almost thence my nature is subdu'd</line>
    <line n="1540">To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:</line>
    <line n="1541">Pity me, then, and wish I were renew'd;</line>
    <line n="1542">Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink,</line>
    <line n="1543">Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection;</line>
    <line n="1544">No bitterness that I will bitter think,</line>
    <line n="1545">Nor double penance, to correct correction.</line>
    <line n="1546">Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye,</line>
    <line n="1547">Even that your pity is enough to cure me.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1548">Your love and pity doth the impression fill,</line>
    <line n="1549">Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;</line>
    <line n="1550">For what care I who calls me well or ill,</line>
    <line n="1551">So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?</line>
    <line n="1552">You are my all-the-world, and I must strive</line>
    <line n="1553">To know my shames and praises from your tongue;</line>
    <line n="1554">None else to me, nor I to none alive,</line>
    <line n="1555">That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.</line>
    <line n="1556">In so profound abysm I throw all care</line>
    <line n="1557">Of others' voices, that my adder's sense</line>
    <line n="1558">To critic and to flatterer stopped are.</line>
    <line n="1559">Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:</line>
    <line n="1560">You are so strongly in my purpose bred,</line>
    <line n="1561">That all the world besides methinks are dead.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1562">Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;</line>
    <line n="1563">And that which governs me to go about</line>
    <line n="1564">Doth part his function and is partly blind,</line>
    <line n="1565">Seems seeing, but effectually is out;</line>
    <line n="1566">For it no form delivers to the heart</line>
    <line n="1567">Of bird, of flower, or shape which it doth latch:</line>
    <line n="1568">Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,</line>
    <line n="1569">Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch;</line>
    <line n="1570">For if it see the rud'st or gentlest sight,</line>
    <line n="1571">The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,</line>
    <line n="1572">The mountain or the sea, the day or night:</line>
    <line n="1573">The crow, or dove, it shapes them to your feature.</line>
    <line n="1574">Incapable of more, replete with you,</line>
    <line n="1575">My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1576">Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,</line>
    <line n="1577">Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?</line>
    <line n="1578">Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,</line>
    <line n="1579">And that your love taught it this alchemy,</line>
    <line n="1580">To make of monsters and things indigest</line>
    <line n="1581">Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,</line>
    <line n="1582">Creating every bad a perfect best,</line>
    <line n="1583">As fast as objects to his beams assemble?</line>
    <line n="1584">O! 'tis the first, 'tis flattery in my seeing,</line>
    <line n="1585">And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:</line>
    <line n="1586">Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,</line>
    <line n="1587">And to his palate doth prepare the cup:</line>
    <line n="1588">If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin</line>
    <line n="1589">That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1590">Those lines that I before have writ do lie,</line>
    <line n="1591">Even those that said I could not love you dearer:</line>
    <line n="1592">Yet then my judgment knew no reason why</line>
    <line n="1593">My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.</line>
    <line n="1594">But reckoning Time, whose million'd accidents</line>
    <line n="1595">Creep in 'twixt vows, and change decrees of kings,</line>
    <line n="1596">Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,</line>
    <line n="1597">Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;</line>
    <line n="1598">Alas! why fearing of Time's tyranny,</line>
    <line n="1599">Might I not then say, 'Now I love you best,'</line>
    <line n="1600">When I was certain o'er incertainty,</line>
    <line n="1601">Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?</line>
    <line n="1602">Love is a babe, then might I not say so,</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="1604">Let me not to the marriage of true minds</line>
    <line n="1605">Admit impediments. Love is not love</line>
    <line n="1606">Which alters when it alteration finds,</line>
    <line n="1607">Or bends with the remover to remove:</line>
    <line n="1608">O, no! it is an ever-fixed mark,</line>
    <line n="1609">That looks on tempests and is never shaken;</line>
    <line n="1610">It is the star to every wandering bark,</line>
    <line n="1611">Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.</line>
    <line n="1612">Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks</line>
    <line n="1613">Within his bending sickle's compass come;</line>
    <line n="1614">Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,</line>
    <line n="1615">But bears it out even to the edge of doom.</line>
    <line n="1616">If this be error and upon me prov'd,</line>
    <line n="1617">I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1618">Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all,</line>
    <line n="1619">Wherein I should your great deserts repay,</line>
    <line n="1620">Forgot upon your dearest love to call,</line>
    <line n="1621">Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;</line>
    <line n="1622">That I have frequent been with unknown minds,</line>
    <line n="1623">And given to time your own dear-purchas'd right;</line>
    <line n="1624">That I have hoisted sail to all the winds</line>
    <line n="1625">Which should transport me farthest from your sight.</line>
    <line n="1626">Book both my wilfulness and errors down,</line>
    <line n="1627">And on just proof surmise, accumulate;</line>
    <line n="1628">Bring me within the level of your frown,</line>
    <line n="1629">But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;</line>
    <line n="1630">Since my appeal says I did strive to prove</line>
    <line n="1631">The constancy and virtue of your love.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1632">Like as, to make our appetite more keen,</line>
    <line n="1633">With eager compounds we our palate urge;</line>
    <line n="1634">As, to prevent our maladies unseen,</line>

    <line n="1636">Even so, being full of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,</line>
    <line n="1637">To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding;</line>
    <line n="1638">And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness</line>
    <line n="1639">To be diseas'd, ere that there was true needing.</line>
    <line n="1640">Thus policy in love, to anticipate</line>
    <line n="1641">The ills that were not, grew to faults assur'd,</line>
    <line n="1642">And brought to medicine a healthful state</line>
    <line n="1643">Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur'd;</line>
    <line n="1644">But thence I learn and find the lesson true,</line>
    <line n="1645">Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="1646">What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,</line>
    <line n="1647">Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,</line>
    <line n="1648">Applying fears to hopes, and hopes to fears,</line>
    <line n="1649">Still losing when I saw myself to win!</line>
    <line n="1650">What wretched errors hath my heart committed,</line>
    <line n="1651">Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!</line>
    <line n="1652">How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted,</line>
    <line n="1653">In the distraction of this madding fever!</line>
    <line n="1654">O benefit of ill! now I find true</line>
    <line n="1655">That better is, by evil still made better;</line>
    <line n="1656">And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,</line>
    <line n="1657">Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.</line>
    <line n="1658">So I return rebuk'd to my content,</line>

    <line n="1663">Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.</line>
    <line n="1664">For if you were by my unkindness shaken,</line>
    <line n="1665">As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time;</line>

    <line n="1669">My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,</line>
    <line n="1670">And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd</line>
    <line n="1671">The humble salve, which wounded bosoms fits!</line>

    <line n="2113">For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,</line>
    <line n="2114">Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;</line>
    <line n="2115">And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,</line>
    <line n="2116">Or made them swear against the thing they see;</line>
    <line n="2117">For I have sworn thee fair; more perjur'd I,</line>
    <line n="2118">To swear against the truth so foul a lie!</line>

  <poem>
    <line n="2119">Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:</line>
    <line n="2120">A maid of Dian's this advantage found,</line>
    <line n="2121">And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep</line>
    <line n="2122">In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;</line>
    <line n="2123">Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love,</line>
    <line n="2124">A dateless lively heat, still to endure,</line>
    <line n="2125">And grew a seeting bath, which yet men prove</line>
    <line n="2126">Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.</line>
    <line n="2127">But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,</line>
    <line n="2128">The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;</line>
    <line n="2129">I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,</line>
    <line n="2130">And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,</line>
    <line n="2131">But found no cure, the bath for my help lies</line>
    <line n="2132">Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.</line>

  </poem>
  <poem>
    <line n="2133">The little Love-god lying once asleep,</line>
    <line n="2134">Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,</line>
    <line n="2135">Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep</line>
    <line n="2136">Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand</line>
    <line n="2137">The fairest votary took up that fire</line>
    <line n="2138">Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;</line>
    <line n="2139">And so the general of hot desire</line>
    <line n="2140">Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.</line>
    <line n="2141">This brand she quenched in a cool well by,</line>
    <line n="2142">Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,</line>
    <line n="2143">Growing a bath and healthful remedy,</line>
    <line n="2144">For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,</line>
    <line n="2145">Came there for cure and this by that I prove,</line>
    <line n="2146">Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.</line>
